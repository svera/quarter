// Package quarter is a toolkit built on top of Pixel, which provides several libraries to
// aid in the development of 2D games. It aims to be:
// * Simple, so it is easy to learn and use, providing a coherent API.
// * Focused, as it is oriented to build 2D arcade games only.
// * Modular, just include those packages you're interested in.
// * Fast, performance should be the best it can, provided that this goal does not collide with the previous ones.
